Using UWSDR with SoftRock Hardware
==================================

The UWSDR GUI has been adapted to work with SoftRock hardware, both the original receivers and the RXTX. To use the RXTX two sound cards are needed whereas for just the receiver only one is needed, although two can be handled. A set of .sdr files have been created that cover a number of SoftRock configurations, and these have names like SoftRock-40 and SoftRock-80-RXTX, the meaning of each should be obvious! If you have some home made hardware that covers other bands which aren't covered by the existing .sdr files, simply copy the one which is closest to your requirements and edit it. The Skeleton.sdr is a guide as to which fields mean what.

Your chosen .sdr file may need to be edited before use in order to accomodate the frequency of your crystal. Within the .sdr file the entries for lowFreq and highFreq are the same and should be the same as the frequency sent to the mixer, typically a sub-harmonic of the crystal frequency. If these values are not identical then an error will be shown by the GUI at start time and you will not be able to use it.

The SDR Setup program is NOT needed for using SoftRock's and can be ignored, it is only for use with authentic UWSDR hardware.

You will need to use GUI Setup and set up the values for the User Audio, SDR Audio and if using a SoftRock RXTX, also the Control Port. If using an RXTX, the User Audio and SDR Audio must point to different audio devices, GUI Setup will try to enforce this, but it is possible to confuse it and cause the GUI not to operate correctly.

From now on using the GUI is the same as for all hardware, the only differences being some of the Preferences entries not being available and some of the GUI control being grayed out.
