UWSDR 0.5
=========

These are useful files that are needed for installing UWSDR on Windows
and Linux. The files UWSDR.nsi and *.ico are for use with NSIS (a
free Windows installer). The rest of the files are needed to install under
Gnome and KDE, I have done my work on SuSE 8.2 so the paths may be wrong,
the makefile is used to install (and remove) the components needed to
integrate UWSDR into both environments.
