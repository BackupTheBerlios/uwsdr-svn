Building UWSDR
==============

Windows
-------

Everything required to build the software is to be found in the SVN repository, but you will also need Visual C++ 6.0 and wxWidgets 2.6.0 or later. The standard installation of wxWidgets puts it into a folder in the root directory, this folder name is hard coded in the Visual C++ project files. This is easily changed to match your installation.

WxWidgets can be found at http://www.wxwidgets.org

The versions of FFTW 3 and PortAudio V19 are included pre-built in SVN and should be used.

Once built, if you want to build a proper installable version of the software, you should install the Nullsoft installation software, to be found at http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page

The configuration file for NSIS is to be found in the meta directory. You will probably have to edit the UWSDR.nsi file to refelect the paths of your executables. Run NSIS against the UWSDR.nsi file and all being well you'll have a proper Windows install executable.


Linux/Unix
----------

Before building the software you need to ensure that you have the pre-requisites installed, either as packages or built from source.

wxWidgets 2.6.0 or later should be installed. This can be found at http://www.wxwidgets.org and will take some time to build. If you install it as a package then ensure that the devel section is installed as well.

FFTW 3 should be either installed ot built. This can be found at http://www.fftw.org and if building it yourself, you *may* have to configure it as:

$ ./configure --enable-float

I would like feedback on this issue. Is it needed, or is it default?

You will need libsndfile which can be found at http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/ if it doesn't come with your installation.

Finally you will need PortAudio V19. This is still in beta, and has been for years, and can be found at http://www.portaudio.com/usingsvn.html and download the pa_snapshot_v19.tar.gz file. Build this and install it as per its instrucions.

Once all of these packages are installed, you can build the UWSDR software. From the command line type:

$ make

Which should build all of the programs without errors.

Then, logged on as root, type:

$ make install

Which will put the executables in /usr/local/bin and the icons and other files into /usr/local/share/uwsdr. These locations can be changed from the top level Makefile.
