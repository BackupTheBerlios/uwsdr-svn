# This file describes the hardware configuration of the Skeleton SDR. User
# settings are not stored here, these settings are for the hardware and
# should not be modified.
#

#
# The name of the SDR hardware that this file refers to.
#
name=Skeleton SDR

#
# The control of the hardware may be via a number of different hardware interfaces,
# the valid values are "audiorx" for something like a SoftRock, "demo" for a working
# transmit and receive GUI but no hardware connected, and "uwsdr1" for the first
# version of the uwsdr hardware (using the Ethernet port).
#
type=demo

#
# The frequency limits of the hardware, in MHz. For the "audiorx" type above, the low and
# high frequencies must be the same.
#
lowFreq=2300
highFreq=2450

#
# The local oscillator step size in Hertz. This is unused for the "audiorx" type.
#
stepSize=10000.0

#
# This is the sample rate of the CODEC, this is somewhat important. The value
# is in samples per second. For the "audiorx" type it is the sample rate of the
# sound card, the higher the sample rate, the greater the tuning range.
#
sampleRate=48000

#
# It is possible that a receive only SDR will be produced, so there is no point
# sending it transmit commands or data to it. 1 for receive only, 0 for the full
# monty. For a type of "audiorx" above, it is set to receive only within the GUI.
#
receiveOnly=0
