SDR Installation
================

There are five programs. UWSDR/UWSDR.exe which is the SDR GUI itself, SDREmulator/SDREmulator.exe which is as the name suggests, an emulator for the SDR, GUISetup/GUISetup.exe which sets up the required parameters to start the SDR, SDRHelp/SDRHelp.exe which allows access to the documentation, and finally SDRSetup/SDRSetup.exe which sets the initial parameters of the SDR hardware.

To start you need to setup the GUI. Run GUISetup/GUISetup.exe and choose a name for your SDR, then an SDR filename. A suitable file, named 13cms.sdr is included, choose that one. The Audio API to use should be selected, followed by the Audio  Device. On Windows the API choice is MME, DirectAudio and ASIO. These are in reverse order of preference with ASIO better than DirectAudio which is in turn better than MME. Choose the best that your sound card supports. For Linux the choices are ALSA or OSS. With modern versions of Linux, OSS is a layer on top of ALSA, so choose ALSA.

The IP Address of the SDR will be "localhost" unless you intend to test between two PCs. The control port hould be an unused port number on your PC, I use 5003.

You then have the option to create a start menu entry for your new SDR instance and, depending on the platform, an option to create a desktop icon for it also. For running the GUI, all you need to do is click on the menu entry/icon that is created by GUISetup.

Pressing Create will put these initial parameters into the registry/configuration file. You can change these values later, the name of existing configurations will appear on the drop down menu. Changing the values here will not change any other values associated with the named SDR if it already exists.

If nothing changes, you shouldn't need to run GUISetup again, unless you get another SDR.

It is possible to have multiple names for one physical SDR, this can happen if the SDR is used (for example) for both tropo and EME work. If you have two such names (say 13cms-Tropo and 13cms-EME) then each will have it's own settings for the VFO's and other parameters. Obviously only one GUI for each physical SDR may be running at a time.

Now you need to run the SDREmulator. Run the program with the port number that you used for the control port above, as an argument. So in my case I use "SDREmulator 5003". This will bring up a window where you can see interaction with the GUI. You will need to run this every time you use the SDR GUI, until we have a real SDR to play with.

Now run the SDR GUI itself, this is named UWSDR/UWSDR.exe and now takes a mandatory argument. This is the name that you entered into the Name entry in GUISetup above. You may have a desktop icon or menu entry for it, this will currently *not* be useful since it assumes that you will be running without the SDR Emulator. You must start it manually via the command line interface or modify the shortcut/menu entry and remove the "-s" in the program parameters.
