<p>This screen handles the less commonly required settings for the receiver. These are the settings for two different noise blankers, one for impulse noise (Impulse Noise Blanker) and a more general noise blanker (Mean Noise Blanker). Both of these may be enabled with the buttons to the left of the slide controls.</p>
<p>The amount of attenuation ahead of the IF strip may also be set here. With the attenuation set to it's rightmost position there is no attenuation whereas the leftmost position is maximum attenuation which is 30dB.</p>
