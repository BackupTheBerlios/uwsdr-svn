<p>It is possible to embed repeated text like callsigns in a message by using one of the text boxes at the top, labelled: "My callsign (%M)", "Remote callsign (%R)", "Locator (%Q)", "Report (%S)" and "Serial (%N)". These are subsituted in the message whenever the %M, %R, %Q, %S or %N characters are found in the text. The speed that the message is sent at may also be set.</p>
