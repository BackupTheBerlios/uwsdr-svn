<p>This screen allows for the setting of the gain and phase imbalance between the I and Q channels on both transmit and receive. This is needed to cancel imbalances within the hardware. A value of zero means no change in either the gain or phase.</p>
<p>The Method chooses the way that the I and Q signals are generated and presented to the hardware. The Hartley method is the traditional SDR way of doing things where an imbalance of I/Q signals causes an image which effectively doubles the bandwidth of the transmitter. The Weaver method ensures that any imbalance occurs as an image which appears on the same frequency, albeit inverted, as the original transmission. The choice is fixed at Hartley if the tuning steps of the hardware are greater than 100Hz.</p>
