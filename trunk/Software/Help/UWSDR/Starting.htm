<p>The UWSDR GUI may be started in a number of ways. Depending on the operating system and the options selected in GUI Setup not all of them may be available to you.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clicking on icons created by GUI Setup in either a program menu or from the Desktop.</p></li>
<br />
<li><p>Typing the command in at a command line shell, in the form</p>
<pre>UWSDR &lt;name&gt;</pre>
</p>where &lt;name&gt; is the name given in GUI Setup. This option does not work correctly with Mac OS X.</p></li>
<br />
<li><p>Typing the command in at a command line shell, in the form</p>
<pre>UWSDR</pre>
</p>in this case the last GUI configuration used will be taken. This option does not work correctly with Mac OS X.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If no configuration name is given, or there was no previous configuarion used, or the name passed is invalid, then an error box will appear and the GUI will not start.</p>
