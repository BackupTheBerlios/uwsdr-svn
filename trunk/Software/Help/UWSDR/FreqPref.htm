<p>This screen sets the transmit and receive limits of the SDR. The sdr description file sets the absolute hardware limits whereas this screen is used to set the regulatory limits. The receive limits must be the same or within the hardware limits, and the transmit limits must be the same or within the receive limits. These values are in Megahertz.</p>
<p>The Frequency Shift to be used by the <a href="TuningButtons.htm">SHIFT + and SHIFT -</a> buttons, this is typically used for repeater operation. This value is given in Kilohertz.</p>
<p>The Frequency Offset is a means by which a difference in frequency between the display on the GUI and reality may be removed. This is particularly important when the SDR is not locked to a high quality frequency standard. This value is given in Hertz.</p>
