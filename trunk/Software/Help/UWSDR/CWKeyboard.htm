<p>The CW Keyboard entry on the <a href="Menu.htm">Menu</a> brings up a new window where a number of pre-set messages and a real-time keyboard may be chosen from. Real-time keying is possible by using an external key input via the serial port which can be set up via GUISetup. Pressing the external key while sending a message from the CW Keyboard will abort it.</p>
