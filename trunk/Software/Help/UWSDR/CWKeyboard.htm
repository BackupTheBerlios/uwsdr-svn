<p>The CW Keyboard brings up a new windows where a number of pre-set messages may be chosen from. The keyboard doesn't allow for real-time typing of messages, but instead having a number of pre-set messages. Real-time keying is possible by using an external key input via the serial port which can be set up via GUISetup. Pressing the external key while sending a message from the CW Keyboard will abort it.</p>
