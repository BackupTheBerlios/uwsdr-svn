<p>This is rotated by moving the mouse over it, and pressing either the left or right mouse buttons. This is an auto-repeat system so keeping the button pressed will tune the SDR continuously. The speed of tuning is set by the Speed setting, see later. This can further be controlled by the position where the mouse is when the button is pressed. The white lines indicate the different zones, nearer the centre is slower, and further out is faster. It can also be tuned by using the mouse wheel at a rate faster than the slowest setting, but slower than the medium setting.</p>
<p>The <a href="FreqKeypad.htm">Frequency Keypad</a> can also be used for changing the frequency.</p>
<p>It is possible to tune the SDR via the mouse and <a href="SpectrumDisplay.htm">Spectrum Display</a> by pointing and clicking with the left hand mouse button.</p>
