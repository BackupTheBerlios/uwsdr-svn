<p>The Type of the Spectrum Display can be changed by accessing the Type Menu from the Spectrum Display menu. There are three types of display, Panadpter and Waterfall.</p>
<p>The Panadapter types are just slightly different visual representations of the essentially the same image. It is similar in form to that shown by a spectrum analyser, with frequency being the horizontal axis and amplitude the vertical axis. Each horizontal line represents 5 dB.</p>
<p>The Waterfall type is common amongst software, in it a history of the signal and its amplitude over a length of time. The horizontal axis is frequency, the vertical axis is time, and the amplitude is shown via the different colours used.</p>
