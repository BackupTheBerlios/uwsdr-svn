<p>The Transmit Button is the primary means of controlling transmit/receive switching when in a voice mode, it cannot be used to start a CW transmission, that is done via the <a href="CWButtons.htm">Send button</a> on the <a href="CWKeyboard.htm">CW Keyboard</a>. It can be used to abort an already started CW transmission.</p>
<p>If the SDR is receive only then the transmit button will be grayed out and will not work when pressed.</p>
