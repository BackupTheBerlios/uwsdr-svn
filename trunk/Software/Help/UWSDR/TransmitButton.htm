<p>The Transmit Button is the primary means of controlling transmit/receive switching, and it operates in parallel with the external transmit/receive switching via the serial port if enabled. It may also be used to abort an already started CW transmission from the <a href="CWKeyboard.htm">CW Keyboard</a>. If an external key is specified within GUISetup then the Transmit Button may also be used in CW mode.</p>
<p>If the SDR is receive only then the transmit button will be grayed out and will not work when pressed.</p>
