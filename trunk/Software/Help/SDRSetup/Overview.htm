<body>
<p>The purpose of SDRSetup is to initialise a brand new SDR for use on your network. The default address that the SDR has is unlikely
to be usable on your home network, therefore it is important to communicate with it to tell it what it's new IP address and port
numbers it must use. Typically SDRSetup will only need to be used once per SDR.</p>
