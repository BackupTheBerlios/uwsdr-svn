<title>New SDR Control Port</title>

<body>
<p>This is the desired new control port number for your SDR. Unlike the IP address, this does not need to be unique, as long as it is
not the same as the <a href="NewSDRDataPort.htm">data port</a>. Using the same number as as the default (5001) is perfectly
acceptable unless some local restriction applies.</p>
