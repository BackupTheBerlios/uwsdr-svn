<p>Once all of the parameters are correct then the Execute button should be pressed. This will send the appropriate commands to
the SDR which must be attached by this time. If the commands have been accepted by the SDR then a confirmation window will appear,
otherwise an error window will pop up instead. Closing the confirmation window will also close SDRSetup. SDRSetup will attempt to
provide useful information about the error, but this may not be possible if the network is mis-configured.</p>
