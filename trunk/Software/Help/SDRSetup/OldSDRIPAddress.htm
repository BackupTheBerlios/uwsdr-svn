<body>
<p>This is the current IP address of the SDR, if it is straight out of the box then it will have an address of 192.168.0.5, and if
not then it will be whatever value it has previously been set to. It is important that your PC can reach this address which may
mean temporarily reconfiguring your network connection so that you are both on the same sub-net.</p>
