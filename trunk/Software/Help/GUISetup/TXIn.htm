<p>If the SDR is capable of transmitting then it is possible to control the transmit/receive switching via the serial port as well as the GUI screen. The serial port must be chosen, as well as the two pins that must be shorted to enable transmission. The first eight serial ports are listed, although there presence in this list does not guarantee their availability.</p>
