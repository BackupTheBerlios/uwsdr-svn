<p>Penelope is the HPSDR module that is the heart of the transmit side, it directly data from the USB connector to RF in the HF spectrum. It contains a number of settable parameters.</p>
<p>Penelope can deliver a 10MHz reference which is also potentially available via Atlas or from Mercury. Setting it to Penelope will automatically set it off from the other two sources.</p>
<p>Both Penelope and Mercury have a 122.8MHz source within them, and if both modules are fitted a choice has to be made. Setting it to be from one will disable the other source.</p>
<p>Even if you don't use Penelope for any of the functions defined on this screen, but you have a Penelope installed then you should set this option.</p>
<p>Penelope can handle the microphone needed for transmitting. It is also possible to attach a microphone to the Janus module, so a choice is available. Setting the microphone to come from Penelope will disable it from Janus and vice versa.</p>
