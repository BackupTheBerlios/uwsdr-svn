<p>Atlas is the HPSDR backplane and is essentially passive. However it can deliver a 10MHz reference signal from an external source, if this is not present then the 10MHz reference must be obtained from either Mercury or Penelope. Setting it to Atlas will automatically set it off from the other two sources.</p>
