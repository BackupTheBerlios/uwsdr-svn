<p>This allows for the selection of the specific serial port and pin to control a SoftRock RXTC like SDR. The list is made up of the first eight serial ports that are potentially available on a PC, the connection may be either RTS or DTR. The existence of a serial port on this list does not imply that it exists on your particular hardware.</p>
