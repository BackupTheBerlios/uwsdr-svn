<p>This is the screen that allows you to create, or modify, an SDR name. The screen will br broadly similar in appearance on all
platforms, however the choices available will vary. For simplicity the majority of the images will be taken from GUISetup
running under Windows XP.</p>
<p>The differences will manifest themselves as different choices for the Audio API and the switches for creating menu entries and/or
desktop icons.</p>
