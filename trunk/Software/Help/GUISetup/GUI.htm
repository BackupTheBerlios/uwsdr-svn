<p>This is the screen that allows you to create, or modify, an SDR name. The screens will be broadly similar in appearance on all
platforms, however the choices available will vary. The availablility of the Set buttons depends on the type of SDR that is
specified in the SDR file. In all cases the <a href="UserAudio.htm">User Audio</a> will need to be set, and one or none of the other buttons also.</p>
<p>If you fail to set some of the values then an error will appear when you press the <a href="CreateButton.htm">Create</a> button.</p>
