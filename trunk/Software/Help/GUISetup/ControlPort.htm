<p>If the SDR allows for transmission then it is possible to control the keying and transmit state via the serial port, using the <a href="TXIn.htm">Transmit In</a> and <a href="KeyIn.htm">Key In</a> entries. Both of these may be enabled as needed, and if enabled then the relevant port and connections may be set. It is important that the input pins are different, an error is reported if they conflict.</p>
<p>If the SDR is something like a SoftRock RXTX then the <a href="TXOut.htm">Transmit Out</a> must be set in order for the transmitter to be controlled. This screen allows for the choice of the port and of the specific pin to control. It is important that this connection does not conflict with the <a href="TXIn.htm">Transmit In</a> and <a href="KeyIn.htm">Key In</a> if used.</p>
