<body>
<p>Each type of uWSDR SDR has an associated .sdr file that contains information about the capabilities of that SDR. It is a text file
that contains such items as the oscillator step size, upper and lower frequency limits and other important limitations. It is
essential that the SDR name is associated with the correct .sdr file.</p>
<p>To help find the required file, the Browse button at the side
of the file name entry is available. This pops up a standard file selection window which will help you to find the required file.
Once the correct file is found, then pressing OK will make place that file name into the main GUISetup screen.</p>
<p>All of the .sdr files are available from the uWSDR web pages at <a href="http://uwsdr.berlios.de">http://uwsdr.berlios.de</a></p>
