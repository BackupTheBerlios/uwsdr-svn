<p>Once the correct <a href="AudioAPI.htm">Audio API</a> has been selected then it is possible to choose the sound device for use with
your headphones/speakers and microphone. Depending on which platform you are using determines how the list will appear.</p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>The list will always include at least two entries, the name of the device itself, and the Microsoft Sound Mapper, which is another
way to talk of the default sound device sleected via the Control Panel. In the case of only one sound device, they will in fact mean
the same thing.</p>
