<p>Once the correct <a href="AudioAPI.htm">Audio API</a> has been selected then it is possible to choose the sound device for use with
your headphones/speakers and microphone. Depending on which platform you are using determines how the list will appear.</p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>Depending on the API chosen, determines what sound decices will be available.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>MME</b> - The list will always include at least two entries, the name of the device itself, and the Microsoft Sound Mapper, which is another way to talk of the default sound device sleected via the Control Panel. In the case of only one sound device, they will in fact mean the same thing.</li>
<li><b>Windows DirectSound</b> - Windows lists the available sound cards along with two extra pseudo-devices, the Primary Sound Capture Driver and the Primary Sound Driver.</li>
<li><b>ASIO</b> - Normally only one option, the name of the ASIO software, the choice of the sound card is performed from the ASIO setup screen.</li>
