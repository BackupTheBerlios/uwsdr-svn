<p>GUISetup has the ability to create a desktop icon for Windows. By enabling this option, such an icon will be created which can
then be used to start the UWSDR GUI with this SDR name. The icon will have the name of the SDR. It is possible to recreate the
icon by running GUISetup for an existing SDR name and enabling this option and not making any other changes.</p>
