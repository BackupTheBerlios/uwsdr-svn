<p>If the SDR is something like a SoftRock RXTX then the Control Port must be set in order for the transmitter to be controlled. Currently the control must be via a serial port, and this screen allows for the choice of the port and of the specific pin to control. This screen is entered by clicking the Control Port Set button on the main screen.</p>
