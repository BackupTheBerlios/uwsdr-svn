<title>Create Start Menu Entry</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>GUISetup has the ability to create entries in the start menu for Windows and Linux. By enabling this option, such a menu
entry will be created which can then be used to start the UWSDR GUI with this SDR name. The menu entry will have the name of the
SDR. It is possible to recreate the menu entry by running GUISetup for an existing SDR name and enabling this option and not
making any other changes.</p>
<p>It is possible that this option will not appear under Linux. This is due to the configuration of Gnome/KDE not being correct,
or a required directory not being available. If that is the case then the GUI must be started from the command line with the SDR
name as its only parameter.</p>
