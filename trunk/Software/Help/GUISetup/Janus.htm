<p>Janus is the audio ADC and DAC module within HPSDR and it therefore can handle the microphone needed for transmitting. It is also possible to attach a microphone to the Penelope module, so a choice is available. Setting the microphone to come from Janus will disable it from Penelope and vice versa.</p>
