<p>Mercury is the HPSDR module that is the heart of the receive side, it directly samples the HF spectrum and eventually makes it available via the USB connector. It contains a number of settable parameters.</p>
<p>Mercury can deliver a 10MHz reference which is also potentially available via Atlas or from Penelope. Setting it to Mercury will automatically set it off from the other two sources.</p>
<p>Both Mercury and Penelope have a 122.8MHz source within them, and if both modules are fitted a choice has to be made. Setting it to be from one will disable the other source.</p>
<p>Even if you don't use Mercury for any of the functions defined on this screen, but you have a Mercury installed then you should set this option.</p>
<p>The main ADC within Mercury is the LT2208 and that has both an inbuilt pre-amplifier which may be switched on or off, and also the inbuilt dithering may also be controlled.</p>
<p>Mercury incorporates an attenuator which can be set to 0dB (off), 10dB, 20dB or 30dB. This value may be set here.</p>
